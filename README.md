## Data Structure

- a collection of values
- ways of storing information
- values can have relationships among them
- can have functions applied to them.
- container. each container are specific for its own thing.
- such as block chain

- refer to "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures"

1. How to build one
2. How to Use it (and when to use them) -> more important.

- CPU: calculator. Access to RAM and Storage.

  - CPU cache: also CPU can have tiny memory (LRU cache)

- RAM (Randon Access Memory): stores variables. when computer turns off, data in RAM will be removed.
  Fast.
  It's like Massive Storage Area has many shelf called address.
  Each shell has 8 Bits = 1 Byte.  
  CPU can access memory fast becasue it have direct connections through memory controller.
  CPU can access the bits at any random address in memory right away.
  If each shelf(address) are close together to get the same data, computer runs faster. If it's far, it is slower.

- Storage: stores permanant(persistant) such as SSD. Slow

## Each language has its own data structures.

- If some doesn't have specific data structure, you can make it.

## Operation on Data structures

- Insertion: add new data item.
- Deletion: delete data.
- Traversal: Access each data item exactly once.
- Searching: Find out the location of the data item
- Sorting:
- Access: how to access.
